Running Dagit as a service {#local-dagit}
==========================

The core of any deployment of Dagster is a Dagit process that serves a
user interface and responds to GraphQL queries.

Ensure that you are running a recent Python version (Dagster is tested
on Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8). Typically, you\'ll want to run
Dagit inside a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).
Then, you can install Dagit and any additional libraries you might need.

``` {.shell}
$ pip install dagit
```

To run Dagit, you\'ll use a command such as the following:

``` {.shell}
$ DAGSTER_HOME=/opt/dagster/dagster_home dagit -h 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

In this configuration, Dagit will write execution logs to
`$DAGSTER_HOME/logs` and listen on [0.0.0.0:3000]{.title-ref}.

Using systemd
-------------

To run Dagit as a long-lived service, you can install a systemd service
such as the following:

::: {.literalinclude caption="dagit.service"}
systemd/dagit.service
:::

Note that this assumes you\'ve got a virtualenv for Dagster at
`/opt/dagster/venv` and that your pipeline code and `repository.yaml`
are located under `/opt/dagster/app`.

Dagit in Docker
---------------

If you are running on AWS ECS, Kubernetes, or some other container-based
orchestration system, you\'ll likely want to package Dagit using a
Docker image.

A minimal skeleton `Dockerfile` and entrypoint shell script that will
run Dagit and the cron scheduler are shown below:

::: {.literalinclude caption="Dockerfile"}
docker/Dockerfile
:::

In this setup, the contents of `entrypoint.sh` should be something like
the following. This script ensures that cron will run in the Docker
container alongside Dagit:

::: {.literalinclude caption="entrypoint.sh" language="bash"}
docker/entrypoint.sh
:::

In practice, you may want to volume your pipeline code into your
containers to enable deployment patterns such as git-sync sidecars that
avoid the need to rebuild images and redeploy containers when pipeline
code changes.

Dagit servers expose a health check endpoint at `/dagit_info`, which
returns a JSON response like:

``` {.JSON}
{
  "dagit_version": "0.6.6",
  "dagster_graphql_version": "0.6.6",
  "dagster_version": "0.6.6"
}
```

Depending on your deployment philosophy, you may want to run dagit as a
service within your container, use healthchecks as part of a container
restart policy, or both.
