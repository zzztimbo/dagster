Deploying Dagster
=================

Getting started with Dagster is as easy as running:

``` {.shell}
pip install dagit
dagit
```

Dagster supports a wide variety of more sophisticated deployment
strategies for production.

Typically, you\'ll want to deploy Dagit somewhere, configure the way
that it stores information and launches runs, and make sure your
pipelines are configured to run appropriately for your environment.

If you\'re using the Celery engine, you\'ll want to run worker processes
to parallelize execution.

Alternatively, you may want to deploy Dagster pipelines into a
completely different scheduling and execution environment, like Apache
Airflow.

No matter how you\'re planning to deploy Dagster, you should first
understand its default behavior.

You should also be familiar with configuring the Dagster instance, which
organizes all of the information specific to a particular installation
or deployment of Dagster, using `dagster.yaml`.

And you should be aware of the per-pipeline run configuration you\'ll
need for your pipeline runs to take advantage of the environment in
which they\'re deployed.
