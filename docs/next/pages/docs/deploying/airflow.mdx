Deploying to Airflow {#airflow}
====================

It\'s also possible to schedule pipelines for execution by compiling
them to a format that can be understood by a third-party scheduling
system, and then defining schedules within that system.

This is the approach we use to deploy Dagster pipelines to Airflow
(using the
[dagster-airflow](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/python_modules/libraries/dagster-airflow)
package).

We don\'t recommend deploying Dagster pipelines to Airflow in greenfield
installations. (We recommend the built-in [scheduler and partition
system](../tutorial/scheduler.html) for scheduling pipelines, and the
[Celery-based executor](celery.html) for large-scale deployments.) But
if you have a large existing Airflow install, this integration will
allow you to follow an incremental adoption path.

Requirements
------------

You\'ll need an existing Airflow installation, and to install the
`dagster-airflow` library into the Python environments in which your
Airflow webserver and worker run.

``` {.shell}
$ pip install dagster-airflow
```

You\'ll also need to make sure that the Dagster pipeline you want to run
using Airflow is available in the Python environments in which your
Airflow webserver and worker run.

### Overview

A Dagster pipeline is first compiled with a set of config options into
an execution plan, and then the individual execution steps are expressed
as Airflow tasks using one of a set of custom wrapper operators (the
same operator is used for each task in the DAG) . The resulting DAG can
be deployed to an existing Airflow install and scheduled and monitored
using all the tools being used for existing Airflow pipelines.

We support two modes of execution (each of which uses its own operator):

1.  **Uncontainerized \[Default\]**: Tasks are invoked directly on the
    Airflow executors.
2.  **Containerized**: Tasks are executed in Docker containers.

### Quickstart

For this quickstart, we\'ll use our familiar, simple demo pipeline:

::: {.literalinclude linenos="" language="python" caption="airflow.py"}
../../../examples/dagster\_examples/intro\_tutorial/airflow.py
:::

To compile this existing pipeline to Airflow, we\'ll use the
`dagster-airflow` CLI tool. By default, this tool will write the
Airflow-compatible DAG scaffold out to `$AIRFLOW_HOME/dags`.

``` {.shell}
$ dagster-airflow scaffold \
    --module-name dagster_examples.intro_tutorial.airflow \
    --pipeline-name hello_cereal_pipeline
Wrote DAG scaffold to file: $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags/hello_cereal_pipeline.py
```

Let\'s take a look at the generated file:

::: {.literalinclude linenos="" language="python" caption="hello_cereal_pipeline.py"}
../../../examples/dagster\_examples/intro\_tutorial/hello\_cereal\_pipeline.py
:::

This is a fairly straightforward file with four parts.

First, we import the basic prerequisites to define our DAG (and also
make sure that the string \"DAG\" appears in the file, so that the
Airflow webserver will detect it).

Second, we define the config that Dagster will compile our pipeline
against. Unlike Dagster pipelines, Airflow DAGs can\'t be parameterized
dynamically at execution time, so this config is static after it\'s
loaded by the Airflow webserver.

Third, we set the `DEFAULT_ARGS` that will be passed down as the
`default_args` argument to the `airflow.DAG`
[constructor](https://airflow.apache.org/tutorial.html#example-pipeline-definition).

Finally, we define the DAG and its constituent tasks using
:py`make_airflow_dag <dagster_airflow.make_airflow_dag>`{.interpreted-text
role="func"}. If you run this code interactively, you\'ll see that `dag`
and `tasks` are ordinary Airflow objects, just as you\'d expect to see
when defining an Airflow pipeline manually:

``` {.python}
>>> dag
<DAG: hello_cereal_pipeline>
>>> tasks
[<Task(DagsterPythonOperator): hello_cereal>]
```

Within this Airflow DAG, instances of
:py`~dagster_airflow.DagsterPythonOperator`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} represent individual execution steps in the Dagster
pipeline.

You can now edit this file, supplying the appropriate environment
configuration and Airflow `DEFAULT_ARGS` for your particular Airflow
instance. When Airflow sweeps this directory looking for DAGs, it will
find and execute this code, dynamically creating an Airflow DAG and
steps corresponding to your Dagster pipeline.

Note that an extra `storage` parameter will be injected into your
environment dict if it is not set. By default, this will use filesystem
storage, but if your Airflow executors are running on multiple nodes,
you will need either to configure this to point at a network filesystem,
or consider an alternative such as S3 or GCS storage.

You will also need to make sure that all of the Python and system
requirements that your Dagster pipeline requires are available in your
Airflow execution environment; e.g., if you\'re running Airflow on
multiple nodes with Celery, this will be true for the Airflow master and
all workers.

You will also want to make sure you have a process in place to update
your Airflow DAGs, as well as the Dagster code available to the Airflow
workers, whenever your pipelines change.

Using Presets
-------------

The Airflow scaffold utility also supports using presets when generating
an Airflow DAG:

``` {.shell}
$ pip install -e dagster/examples/
$ dagster-airflow scaffold \
    --module-name dagster_examples.toys.error_monster \
    --pipeline-name error_monster \
    --preset passing
```

### Running a pipeline on Airflow

Ensure that the Airflow webserver, scheduler (and any workers
appropriate to the executor you have configured) are running. The
`dagster-airflow` CLI tool will automatically put the generated DAG
definition in `$AIRLFLOW_HOME/dags`, but if you have a different setup,
you should make sure that this file is wherever the Airflow webserver
looks for DAG definitions.

When you fire up the Airflow UI, you should see the new DAG:

::: {.thumbnail}
intro\_airflow\_one.png
:::

Kick off a run manually, and you\'ll be able to use the ordinary views
of the pipeline\'s progress:

::: {.thumbnail}
intro\_airflow\_dag\_view.png
:::

And logs will be available in the Airflow log viewer:

::: {.thumbnail}
intro\_airflow\_logs\_view.png
:::

### Running Containerized

Running containerized, we use a
:py`~dagster_airflow.DagsterDockerOperator`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} to wrap Dagster pipelines.

In order to run containerized Dagster pipelines, you must have Docker
running in your Airflow environment (just as with the ordinary Airflow
:py`DockerOperator <airflow:airflow.operators.docker_operator.DockerOperator>`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}).

Running in a containerized context requires a persistent intermediate
storage layer available to the Dagster containers, such as a network
filesystem, S3, or GCS.

You\'ll also need to containerize your Dagster repository.

Containerizing a Dagster repository
-----------------------------------

Make sure you have Docker installed, and write a Dockerfile like the
following:

``` {.}
# You may use any base container with a supported Python runtime: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7
FROM python:3.7

# Install any OS-level requirements (e.g. using apt, yum, apk, etc.) that the pipelines in your
# repository require to run
# RUN apt-get install some-package some-other-package

# Set environment variables that you'd like to have available in the built image.
# ENV IMPORTANT_OPTION=yes

# If you would like to set secrets at build time (with --build-arg), set args
# ARG super_secret

# Install dagster_graphql
RUN pip install dagster_graphql

# Install any Python requirements that the pipelines in your repository require to run
ADD /path/to/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your repository.yaml file so that dagster_graphql knows where to look to find your repository,
# the Python file in which your repository is defined, and any local dependencies (e.g., unpackaged
# Python files from which your repository definition imports, or local packages that cannot be
# installed using the requirements.txt).
ADD /path/to/repository.yaml .
ADD /path/to/repository_definition.py .
# ADD /path/to/additional_file.py .

# The dagster-airflow machinery will use dagster_graphql to execute steps in your pipelines, so we
# need to run dagster_graphql when the container starts up
ENTRYPOINT [ "dagster_graphql" ]
```

Of course, you may expand on this Dockerfile in any way that suits your
needs.

Once you\'ve written your Dockerfile, you can build your Docker image.
You\'ll need the name of the Docker image (`-t`) that contains your
repository later so that the docker-airflow machinery knows which image
to run. E.g., if you want your image to be called
`dagster-airflow-demo-repository`:

``` {.shell}
$ docker build -t dagster-airflow-demo-repository -f /path/to/Dockerfile .
```

If you want your containerized pipeline to be available to Airflow
operators running on other machines (for example, in environments where
Airflow workers are running remotely) you\'ll need to push your Docker
image to a Docker registry so that remote instances of Docker can pull
the image by name, or otherwise ensure that the image is available on
remote nodes.

For most production applications, you\'ll probably want to use a private
Docker registry, rather than the public DockerHub, to store your
containerized pipelines.

Defining your pipeline as a containerized Airflow DAG
-----------------------------------------------------

As in the uncontainerized case, you\'ll put a new Python file defining
your DAG in the directory in which Airflow looks for DAGs.

``` {.python}
from dagster_airflow.factory import make_airflow_dag_containerized

from my_package import define_my_pipeline

pipeline = define_my_pipeline()

image = 'dagster-airflow-demo-repository'

dag, steps = make_airflow_dag_containerized(
    pipeline,
    image,
    environment_dict={'storage': {'filesystem': {'config': {'base_dir': '/tmp'}}}},
    dag_id=None,
    dag_description=None,
    dag_kwargs=None,
    op_kwargs=None
)
```

You can pass `op_kwargs` through to the the
:py:class\`\~dagster\_airflow.DagsterDockerOperator\` to use custom TLS
settings, the private registry of your choice, etc., just as you would
configure the ordinary Airflow
:py`DockerOperator <airflow:airflow.operators.docker_operator.DockerOperator>`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}.

Docker bind-mount for filesystem intermediate storage
-----------------------------------------------------

By default, the :py:class\`\~dagster\_airflow.DagsterDockerOperator\`
will bind-mount `/tmp` on the host into `/tmp` in the Docker container.
You can control this by setting the `op_kwargs` in
:py`~dagster_airflow.make_airflow_dag`{.interpreted-text role="func"}.
For instance, if you\'d prefer to mount `/host_tmp` on the host into
`/container_tmp` in the container, and use this volume for intermediate
storage, you can run:

``` {.python}
dag, steps = make_airflow_dag(
    pipeline,
    image,
    environment_dict={'storage': {'filesystem': {'config' : {'base_dir': '/container_tmp'}}}},
    dag_id=None,
    dag_description=None,
    dag_kwargs=None,
    op_kwargs={'host_tmp_dir': '/host_tmp', 'tmp_dir': '/container_tmp'}
)
```

Compatibility
-------------

Note that Airflow versions less than 1.10.3 are incompatible with Python
3.7+.
