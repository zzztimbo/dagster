Open Source
===========

Dagster itself, defined as the code and intellectual property in this
repository, will forever and always be free.

We do plan to build a commercial product as a distinct and well-defined
layer on top of Dagster. We believe that this structure will be the most
sustainable for serving our users as the Dagster team and product grows.
