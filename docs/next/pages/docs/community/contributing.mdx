Contributing {#Contributing}
============

If you are planning to contribute to Dagster, you will first need to set
up a local development environment.

Environment Setup
-----------------

1.  Install Python. Python 3.6 or above recommended, but our CI/CD
    pipeline currently tests against up-to-date patch versions of Python
    2.7, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7. Note that dagster is a 2/3 compatible
    project: tests must pass against Python 2.7.
2.  Create and activate a virtualenv, using the tool of your choice.
    E.g., on macOS you may use install and use `pyenv` as follows with
    Homebrew:

``` {.console}
$ brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv
$ pyenv install 3.7.4
$ pyenv virtualenv 3.7.4 dagster37
$ pyenv activate dagster37
```

3.  Ensure that you have node installed by running [node
    -v]{.title-ref}, and that you have
    [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed. If you are on macOS,
    you can install yarn with Homebrew:

``` {.console}
$ brew install yarn
```

4.  Clone the dagster repository to the destination of your choice:

``` {.console}
$ git clone git@github.com:dagster-io/dagster.git
```

5.  Run `make dev_install` at the root of the repository. This sets up a
    full dagster developer environment with all modules and runs tests
    that do not require heavy external dependencies such as docker. This
    will take a few minutes.

``` {.console}
$ make dev_install
```

6.  Run some tests manually to make sure things are working:

``` {.console}
$ python -m pytest python_modules/dagster/dagster_tests
```

Developing Dagster
------------------

Some notes on developing in Dagster:

-   **Python 2**: We plan to continue supporting Python 2 for some time;
    it is worth testing your changes with Python 2 to ensure
    compatibility. You can use [tox]{.title-ref} for this, from within
    any of the Python packages:

``` {.console}
$ PYENV=py27 tox
```

-   **Black/Pylint**: We use [black](https://github.com/python/black) to
    enforce a consistent code style, along with
    [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/). We test these in our CI/CD
    pipeline.
-   **Line Width**: We use a line width of 100.
-   **IDE**: We recommend setting up your IDE to format with black on
    save and check pylint, but you can always run `make black` and
    `make pylint` in the root Dagster directory before submitting a pull
    request. If you\'re also using VS Code, you can see what we\'re
    using for our `settings.json`
    [here](https://gist.github.com/natekupp/7a17a9df8d2064e5389cc84aa118a896).

Developing Dagit
----------------

For development, run the dagit GraphQL server on a different port than
the webapp, from any directory that contains a repository.yaml file. For
example:

``` {.console}
$ cd dagster/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial
$ dagit -p 3333
```

Keep this running. Then, in another terminal, run the local development
(autoreloading, etc.) version of the webapp:

``` {.console}
$ cd dagster/js_modules/dagit
$ make dev_webapp
```

To run JavaScript tests for the dagit frontend, you can run:

``` {.console}
$ cd dagster/js_modules/dagit
$ yarn test
```

In webapp development it\'s handy to run `yarn run jest --watch` to have
an interactive test runner.

Some webapp tests use snapshots\--auto-generated results to which the
test render tree is compared. Those tests are supposed to break when you
change something.

Check that the change is sensible and run `yarn run jest -u` to update
the snapshot to the new result. You can also update snapshots
interactively when you are in `--watch` mode.

Developing Docs
---------------

Running a live html version of the docs can expedite documentation
development:

``` {.console}
$ cd docs
$ make livehtml
```

Our documentation employs a combination of Markdown and
reStructuredText.
