=========

No ecosystem is more heterogeneous than data processing. We
enthusiastically welcome community contributions to code and to docs,
issue and bug reports on
[Github](https://www.github.com/dagster-io/dagster/), and questions,
feature requests, and discussion in our
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/dagster/shared_invite/enQtNjEyNjkzNTA2OTkzLTI0MzdlNjU0ODVhZjQyOTMyMGM1ZDUwZDQ1YjJmYjI3YzExZGViMDI1ZDlkNTY5OThmYWVlOWM1MWVjN2I3NjU).

If you\'re interested in hacking on Dagster, you\'ll want to consult our
instructions on [setting up a local development
environment](contributing.html).

We are committed to making the Dagster project inclusive and welcoming.
Working on this project should feel friendly, collegial, and relaxed for
everyone. We take our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.html) seriously
and encourage you to review it.
