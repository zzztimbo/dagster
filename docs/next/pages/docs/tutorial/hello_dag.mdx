Connecting solids together
==========================

Our pipelines wouldn\'t be very interesting if they were limited to
solids acting in isolation from each other. Pipelines are useful because
they let us connect solids into arbitrary DAGs ([directed acyclic
graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)) of
computation.

Let\'s get serial
-----------------

We\'ll add a second solid to the pipeline we worked with in the first
section of the tutorial.

This new solid will consume the output of the first solid, which read
the cereal dataset in from disk, and in turn will sort the list of
cereals by their calorie content per serving.

You\'ll see that we\'ve modified our existing `load_cereals` solid to
return an output, in this case the list of dicts into which
:py`` `csv.DictReader <python:csv.DictReader> ``{.interpreted-text
role="class"}\` reads the cereals dataset.

We\'ve defined our new solid, `sort_by_calories`, to take a user-defined
input, `cereals`, in addition to the system-provided
:py`context <SystemComputeExecutionContext>`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} object.

We can use inputs and outputs to connect solids to each other. Here we
tell Dagster that although `load_cereals` doesn\'t depend on the output
of any other solid, `sort_by_calories` does \-- it depends on the output
of `load_cereals`.

Let\'s visualize the DAG we\'ve just defined in dagit.

``` {.console}
$ dagit -f serial_pipeline.py -n serial_pipeline
```

Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000/pipeline/serial_pipeline/> or choose
\"serial\_pipeline\" from the dropdown:

A more complex DAG
------------------

Solids don\'t need to be wired together serially. The output of one
solid can be consumed by any number of other solids, and the outputs of
several different solids can be consumed by a single solid.

::: {.literalinclude linenos="" lines="6-64" lineno-start="6" emphasize-lines="55-59" caption="complex_pipeline.py" language="python"}
../../../examples/dagster\_examples/intro\_tutorial/complex\_pipeline.py
:::

First we introduce the intermediate variable `cereals` into our pipeline
definition to represent the output of the `load_cereals` solid. Then we
make both `sort_by_calories` and `sort_by_protein` consume this output.
Their outputs are in turn both consumed by `display_results`.

Let\'s visualize this pipeline in Dagit
(`dagit -f complex_pipeline.py -n complex_pipeline`):

::: {.thumbnail}
complex\_pipeline\_figure\_one.png
:::

When you execute this example from Dagit, you\'ll see that
`load_cereals` executes first, followed by `sort_by_calories` and
`sort_by_protein` \-- in any order \-- and that `display_results`
executes last, only after `sort_by_calories` and `sort_by_protein` have
both executed.

In more sophisticated execution environments, `sort_by_calories` and
`sort_by_protein` could execute not just in any order, but at the same
time, since they don\'t depend on each other\'s outputs \-- but both
would still have to execute after `load_cereals` (because they depend on
its output) and before `display_results` (because `display_results`
depends on both of their outputs).

We\'ll write a simple test for this pipeline showing how we can assert
that all four of its solids executed successfully.
