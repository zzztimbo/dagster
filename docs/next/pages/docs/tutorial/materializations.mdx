<p>Steps in a data pipeline often produce persistent artifacts, for instance, graphs or tables describing the result of some computation. Typically these artifacts are saved to disk (or to cloud storage) with a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1459/">name</a> that has something to do with their origin. But it can be hard to organize and cross-reference artifacts produced by many different runs of a pipeline, or to identify all of the files that might have been created by some pipeline's logic.</p>
<p>Dagster solids can describe their persistent artifacts to the system by yielding :py<code class="interpreted-text" role="class">Materialization &lt;dagster.Materialization&gt;</code> events. Like :py<code class="interpreted-text" role="class">TypeCheck &lt;dagster.TypeCheck&gt;</code> and :py<code class="interpreted-text" role="class">ExpectationResult &lt;dagster.ExpectationResult&gt;</code>, materializations are side-channels for metadata -- they don't get passed to downstream solids and they aren't used to define the data dependencies that structure a pipeline's DAG.</p>
<p>Suppose that we rewrite our <code>sort_calories</code> solid so that it saves the newly sorted data frame to disk.</p>
<div class="literalinclude" data-lines="23-45" data-linenos="" data-lineno-start="23" data-caption="materializations.py" data-language="python">
<p>../../../examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/materializations.py</p>
</div>
<p>We've taken the basic precaution of ensuring that the saved csv file has a different filename for each run of the pipeline. But there's no way for Dagit to know about this persistent artifact. So we'll add the following lines:</p>
<div class="literalinclude" data-lines="23-55" data-linenos="" data-lineno-start="23" data-emphasize-lines="24-33" data-caption="materializations.py" data-language="python">
<p>../../../examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/materializations.py</p>
</div>
<p>Note that we've had to add the last line, yielding an :py<code class="interpreted-text" role="class">Output &lt;dagster.Output&gt;</code>. Until now, all of our solids have relied on Dagster's implicit conversion of the return value of a solid's compute function into its output. When we explicitly yield other types of events from solid logic, we need to also explicitly yield the output so that the framework can recognize them.</p>
<p>Now, if we run this pipeline in Dagit:</p>

</div>
<h2 id="configurably-materializing-custom-data-types">Configurably materializing custom data types</h2>
<p>Data types can also be configured so that outputs materialize themselves, obviating the need to explicitly yield a :py<code class="interpreted-text" role="class">Materialization &lt;dagster.Materialization&gt;</code> from solid logic. Dagster calls this facility the :py<code class="interpreted-text" role="func">@output_materialization_config &lt;dagster.output_materialization_config&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Suppose we would like to be able to configure outputs of our toy custom type, the <code>SimpleDataFrame</code>, to be automatically materialized to disk as both as a pickle and as a .csv. (This is a reasonable idea, since .csv files are human-readable and manipulable by a wide variety of third party tools, while pickle is a binary format.)</p>
<div class="literalinclude" data-lines="28-61" data-linenos="" data-lineno-start="28" data-caption="output_materialization.py" data-language="python">
<p>../../../examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/output_materialization.py</p>
</div>
<p>We set the output materialization config on the type:</p>
<div class="literalinclude" data-lines="64-71" data-linenos="" data-lineno-start="64" data-emphasize-lines="5" data-caption="output_materialization.py" data-language="python">
<p>../../../examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/output_materialization.py</p>
</div>
<p>Now we can tell Dagster to materialize intermediate outputs of this type by providing config:</p>
<div class="literalinclude" data-linenos="" data-emphasize-lines="6-10" data-caption="output_materialization.yaml" data-language="YAML">
<p>../../../examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/output_materialization.yaml</p>
</div>
<p>When we run this pipeline, we'll see that materializations are yielded (and visible in the structured logs in Dagit), and that files are created on disk (with the semicolon separator we specified).</p>
