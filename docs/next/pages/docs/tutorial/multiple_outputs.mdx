Multiple and conditional outputs
================================

Solids can have arbitrarily many outputs, and downstream solids can
depends on any number of these.

What\'s more, outputs don\'t necessarily have to be yielded by solids,
which lets us write pipelines where some solids conditionally execute
based on the presence of an upstream output.

Suppose we\'re interested in splitting hot and cold cereals into
separate datasets and processing them separately, based on config.

../../../examples/dagster\_examples/intro\_tutorial/multiple\_outputs.py
:::

Solids that yield multiple outputs must declare, and name, their outputs
(passing `output_defs` to the
:py`@solid <dagster.solid>`{.interpreted-text role="func"} decorator).
Output names must be unique and each
:py`Output <dagster.Output>`{.interpreted-text role="func"} yielded by a
solid\'s compute function must have a name that corresponds to one of
these declared outputs.

We\'ll define two downstream solids and hook them up to the multiple
outputs from `split_cereals`.

As usual, we can visualize this in Dagit:

Notice that the logical DAG corresponding to the pipeline definition
includes both dependencies \--we won\'t know about the conditionality in
the pipeline until runtime, when one of the outputs is not yielded by
`split_cereal`.

Zooming in, Dagit shows us the details of the multiple outputs from
`split_cereals` and their downstream dependencies.

When we execute this pipeline with the following config, we\'ll see that
the cold cereals output is omitted and that the execution step
corresponding to the downstream solid is marked skipped in the right
hand pane:
