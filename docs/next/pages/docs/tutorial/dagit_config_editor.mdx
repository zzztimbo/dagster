<h1 id="using-the-dagit-config-editor">Using the Dagit config editor</h1>
<p>Dagit provides a powerful, schema-aware, typeahead-enabled config editor to enable rapid experimentation with and debugging of parameterized pipeline executions. As always, run:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>$ dagit -f inputs.py -n inputs_pipeline</code></pre>
<p>Notice that no execution plan appears in the bottom pane of the Playground.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

</div>
<p>Because Dagit is schema-aware, it knows that this pipeline now requires configuration in order to run without errors. In this case, since the pipeline is relatively trivial, it wouldn't be especially costly to run the pipeline and watch it fail. But when pipelines are complex and slow, it's invaluable to get this kind of feedback up front rather than have an unexpected failure deep inside a pipeline.</p>
<p>Recall that the execution plan, which you will ordinarily see above the log viewer in the <strong>Execute</strong> tab, is the concrete pipeline that Dagster will actually execute. Without a valid config, Dagster can't construct a parametrization of the logical pipeline -- so no execution plan is available for us to preview.</p>

<p>Here you can see all of the sections available in the environment dict. Don't worry, we'll get to them all later.</p>
<p>Let's enter the config we need in order to execute our pipeline.</p>

<p>Note that as you type and edit the config, the config minimap hovering on the right side of the editor pane changes to provide context -- so you always know where in the nested config schema you are while making changes.</p>
