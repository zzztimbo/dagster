# Quick start

To install dagster and dagit into an existing Python environment, run:

```bash
$ pip install dagster dagit
```

This will install the latest stable version of the core dagster packages
in your current Python environment.

Dagster is tested on Python 3.7.4, 3.6.9, 3.5.7, and 2.7.16.

Using Python 3 is strongly encouraged. As a reminder, the [official
EOL](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) for Python 2 was
January 1, 2020.

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed
in your environment, you can run:

```bash
$ python --version
$ pip --version
```

We strongly recommend installing dagster inside a Python virtualenv. If
you are running Anaconda, you should install dagster inside a Conda
environment.

If you would like to install dagster from source, please see the section
on `Contributing <Contributing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
