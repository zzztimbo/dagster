Telemetry
=========

As an open source project, we collect usage statistics to inform
development priorities. Telemetry data will motivate projects such as
adding features in frequently-used parts of the CLI and adding more
examples in the docs in areas where users encounter more errors.

For example, we monitor the error rate of `dagster execute pipeline`
invocations to help us ensure our programming model is intuitive to use
and to catch docs regressions.

We will not see or store solid definitions (including generated context)
or pipeline definitions (including modes and resources). We will not see
or store any data that is processed within solids and pipelines.

The default is opt-out. If you\'d like to opt-in, you can add the
following to `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml` (creating that file if
necessary):

``` {.yaml}
telemetry:
  enabled: true
```
