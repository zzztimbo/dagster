Installing Python and pip
=========================

::: {.toctree hidden=""}

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed
in your environment, you can run:

``` {.console}
$ python --version
$ pip --version
```

If you\'re running Python 3.3 or later, you already have the venv
package for managing virtualenvs. On Python 2.7, you can check whether
you have the virtualenv tool installed by running:

``` {.console}
$ virtualenv --version
```

If these tools aren\'t present on your system, you can install them as
follows:

**Installing Python on Ubuntu**

``` {.console}
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
```

This will install Python 3 and pip on your system.

**Installing Python on macOS**

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

``` {.console}
$ brew update
$ brew install python  # Python 3
```

This will install Python 3 on your system.

If you are using the macOS-provided Python 2.7, you can install
virtualenv with:

``` {.console}
$ sudo pip install -U virtualenv  # system-wide install
```

**Installing Python on Windows**

-   Install the *Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3*.
    This comes with *Visual Studio 2015* but can be installed separately
    as follows:
    1.  Go to the Visual Studio downloads,
    2.  Select *Redistributables and Build Tools*,
    3.  Download and install the *Microsoft Visual C++ 2015
        Redistributable Update 3*.
-   Install the 64-bit Python 3 release for Windows (select `pip` as an
    optional feature).

To use the `dagit` tool, you will also need to [install
yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

**Notes on Python virtualenvs**

We strongly recommend installing dagster inside a Python virtualenv.

If you are running Anaconda, you should install dagster inside a Conda
environment.

To create a virtual environment on Python 3, you can just run:

``` {.console}
$ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/dagster
```

This will create a new Python environment whose interpreter and
libraries are isolated from those installed in other virtual
environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a "system"
Python installed as part of your operating system.

On Python 2, you can use a tool like
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to manage your virtual environments, or just run:

``` {.console}
$ virtualenv ~/.venvs/dagster
```

You\'ll then need to \'activate\' the virtualenvironment, in bash by
running:

``` {.console}
$ source ~/.venvs/dagster/bin/activate
```

(For other shells, see the [venv
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).)

If you are using Anaconda, you can run:

``` {.console}
$ conda create --name dagster
```

And then, on macOS or Ubuntu:

``` {.console}
$ source activate dagster
```

Or, on Windows:

``` {.console}
$ activate dagster
```
