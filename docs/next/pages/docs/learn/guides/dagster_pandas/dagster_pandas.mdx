Pandas is a broadly adopted library for data transformations. Dagster
pandas is a library that provides the ability to easily express custom
dataframe types that perform data validation, emit summary statistics,
and enable reliable dataframe serialization/deserialization. On top of
this, the dagster type system generates documentation of your dataframe
constraints and makes it accessible via Dagit.

Creating Dagster DataFrame Types {#creating_dagster_dataframes}
--------------------------------

To create a custom dagster pandas type, use
`create_dagster_pandas_dataframe_type` and provide a list of
`PandasColumn` objects which specify column-level schema and
constraints. For example, we can construct a custom dataframe type to
represent a set of e-bike trips in the following way:

::: {.literalinclude caption="core_trip_pipeline.py" lines="9-22" language="python"}
../../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/dagster\_pandas\_guide/core\_trip\_pipeline.py
:::

Once our custom data type is defined, we can use it as the type
declaration for the inputs / outputs of our solid:

::: {.literalinclude caption="core_trip_pipeline.py" lines="25-31" language="python"}
../../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/dagster\_pandas\_guide/core\_trip\_pipeline.py
:::

By passing in these `PandasColumn` objects, we are expressing the schema
and constraints we expect our dataframes to follow when dagster performs
type checks for our solids. Moreover, if we go to the solid viewer, we
can follow our schema documented in dagit:

Dagster DataFrame Level Validation {#dataframe_level_validation}
----------------------------------

Now that we have a custom dataframe type that performs schema validation
during a pipeline run, we can start to express dataframe level
constraints (e.g number of rows, or columns).

We can do this by providing a list of dataframe constraints to
`create_dagster_pandas_dataframe_type`. These constraint objects live in
`dagster_pandas/constraints.py`. Two such constraints are the
`RowCountConstraint` and `StrictColumnsConstraint`.

This looks like:

::: {.literalinclude lines="9-11" caption="shape_constrained_pipeline.py" language="python"}
../../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/dagster\_pandas\_guide/shape\_constrained\_pipeline.py
:::

If we rerun the above example with this dataframe, nothing should
change. However, if we pass in 100 to the row count constraint, we can
watch our pipeline fail that type check.

Dagster DataFrame Summary Statistics {#dataframe_summary_statistics}
------------------------------------

Aside from constraint validation, `create_dagster_pandas_dataframe_type`
also takes in a summary statistics function that emits
`EventMetadataEntry` objects which are surfaced during pipeline runs.
Since data systems seldom control the quality of the data they receive,
it becomes important to monitor data as it flows through your systems.
In complex pipelines, this can help debug and monitor data drift over
time. Let\'s illustrate how this works in our example:

::: {.literalinclude lines="10-39" caption="summary_stats_pipeline.py" language="python"}
../../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/dagster\_pandas\_guide/summary\_stats\_pipeline.py
:::

Now if we run this pipeline in the dagit playground:

Dagster DataFrame Custom Validation {#custom_validation}
-----------------------------------

`PandasColumn` is user-pluggable with custom constraints. They can be
constructed directly and passed a list of `ColumnConstraint` objects.

To tie this back to our example, let\'s say that we want to validate
that the amount paid for a e-bike must be in 5 dollar increments because
that is the price per mile rounded up. As a result, let\'s implement a
`DivisibleByFiveConstraint`. To do this, all it needs is a
`markdown_description` for dagit which accepts and renders markdown
syntax, an `error_description` for error logs, and a validation method
which throws a `ColumnConstraintViolationException` if a row fails
validation. This would look like the following:

::: {.literalinclude lines="15-40" caption="custom_column_constraint_pipeline.py" emphasize-lines="22-24" language="python"}
../../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/dagster\_pandas\_guide/custom\_column\_constraint\_pipeline.py
