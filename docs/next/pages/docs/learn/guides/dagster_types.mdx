Dagster Types
=============

Every dependency between solids in dagster is attached to an input and
output. Each of these inputs and outputs are annotated with a type
within the dagster type system. The type system is *gradual* and
*optional*. Inputs and outputs default to the `Any` type.

The dagster type system is independent from the PEP 484 Python type
system, although we overload the type annotation syntax on functions to
make it easier to specify the input and output types of your solids.

A solid\'s metadata are meant to be self-describing and reusable. A
solid, ideally, communicates through metadata the conditions required in
order for successful execution. Put another way, through metadata it
describes the state of the external world that must exist for the
computation to succeed.

These conditions are expressed through three different abstractions:

1.  Environment: Solids communicate their environment requirements
    through [required\_resource\_keys]{.title-ref}. Examples of
    environment requirements include a database connections or a spark
    context. Resources specified in this way are accessible via the
    [context]{.title-ref} object passed to the body of solids.
2.  Configuration: Solids declare a schema for their configuration.
    Configuration expresses parameters that are control or behavioral
    concerns which would never be produced by previous computation.
3.  Data Requirements: Solids ingest data and produce data. Inputs
    represent either existing data whose value are managed by dagster\'s
    intermediate store \-- such as a dataframe \-- or the representation
    of data not managed by dagster\'s intermediate store \-- such as a
    database table.

The type system and the input/out system is designed to capture and
model the third category: data requirements.

Dagster types pass or fail typechecks based on arbitrary, user-defined
computation. This allows types to express data requirements with maximum
flexibility, going far beyond the capabilities of Python\'s builtin
types. This flexibility has costs, as it does not guarantee the ability
of types to verify compatibility prior to computation.

Features of Dagster Types:

-   **Gradual and Optional**: Typechecks are use-defined computation
    that is arbitrarily strict.
-   **Self-Describing**: Types include a description and metadata,
    accessible via an API and, therefore, tooling.
-   **Configuration**: Inputs modeled Dagster types can be hydrated from
    existing via configuration, and similarly outputs can be
    materialized to user-controlled locations. Types declare their
    config schema requires and define a function that translates the
    config value into an in-memory value from existing data made
    available as an input.
-   **API**: All metadata is accessible over an API and available for
    tool building.
-   **Compute-time Metadata**: Type checks can return structured
    metadata \-- e.g. summary statistics \-- at runtime, also accessible
    over an API.
-   **Serialization**: Types determine serialization behavior, used by
    dagster\'s intermediate store infrastructure to pass data between
    solids that reside in different processes or nodes at runtime.

DagsterType
-----------

The core API for creating dagster types is DagsterType.

../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

Once created, this type can be attached to solids via either an a)
`InputDefinition` and `OutputDefinition` or b) type annotations.

::: {.literalinclude lines="51-56" caption="types_on_definitions.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

Using python 3 and type annotations, the exact same declaration can be
expressed:

::: {.literalinclude lines="33-35" caption="type_annotations.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

When raw DagsterTypes are passed, this is not compliant with mypy or
other python static type-checking system (we will refer to just mypy
throughout the remainder of this document for convenience). We detail
how to do that later in this document.

The type\_check\_fn must succeed by returning either `True` or a
`TypeCheck` object with `success` set to True for the type check to
pass. If either the input value or the output value fails the associated
typecheck, then the solid will be marked as a failure and any downstream
solids will not be executed.

### Scalars

Dagster exports top level scalars \-- `Int`, `Bool`, `String`, `Float`
\-- that can be used as DagsterType instances. For convenience, one can
use the corresponding python built-in scalars \-- `int`, `bool`, `str`,
`float` \-- to specify the corresponding dagster scalar types. This also
makes these arguments mypy-compliant. There is a 1:1 relationship
between the python type \-- e.g. `int` \-- and its corresponding dagster
type \-- e.g. `dagster.Int` and a mapping between them is maintained by
the system. This means that those python types can be used in
InputDefinitions or OutputDefinitions. If passed as type annotation to
solids, the corresponding DagsterType will also be picked up by the
system.

As we will see later, the user can also define their own 1:1
relationships between python and dagster types.

PythonObjectDagsterType
-----------------------

Although type checks are very flexible, it is also common to define
types that just do [isinstance]{.title-ref} checks as the dagster type
check. We provided an API to do just that.

::: {.literalinclude lines="67-72" caption="python_object_dagster_type.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

One can now declare the dagster type as the interface to the solid, and
use the corresponding python type in business logic.

::: {.literalinclude lines="74-80" caption="dagster_type_annotations.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

The examples above are contrived. The type system truly shines once the
type check expresses richer behavior, such as column-level schema on a
dataframe. The dagster-pandas library is an example of that capability
(link).

Configurability
---------------

Solids are parameterized by their inputs. When executing a pipeline or
solid whose data are not produced by a dependency \-- very common for a
solid at the beginning of a pipeline or execution subset \-- the data
need to come from somewhere. This is specified by config.

The type must declare its interaction with the config system. This means
declaring the input schema and a function which the validated config
value and produces a valid in-memory value to be passed to the schema.
This process is referred to as hydration.

::: {.literalinclude lines="86-99" caption="input_hydration_config.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

With this the input can be specified via config as below:

::: {.literalinclude lines="101-108" caption="execute_with_yaml.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

Output values can also be materialized to a user-controlled location
using config in a similar fashion.

Dagster Type Use Cases
----------------------

Dagster types are checked via arbitrary, user-defined computation, and
can be used to cover a wide variety of use cases common within data
applications.

Inputs and Outputs can represent, via the type system:

1)  **In-Memory-Data**: In-memory data that is either produced a
    previous computation or specified via configuration. Dagster
    infrastructure \-- the intermediates store \-- handles the
    serialization the transfer between of these data in cases whereas
    multiple processes or nodes are being used to run the orchestration
    cluster.
2)  **Metadata**: Metadata about data that is managed by the user but
    not the intermediates store. The type system would ensure that the
    in-memory metadata format is correct and that any preconditions
    about the in situ data are met. An example of this would be a data
    lake with a user-defined URL scheme.
3)  **Preconditions**: Preconditions about external state necessary for
    computation to succeed. An example of this is a hard-coded database
    table name. In some pipelines, parameterizing this is not necessary,
    as testability might be achieved by swapping out an environmental
    concern, such as a database instance.
4)  **Execution Ordering**: In some pipelines there is no data to pass
    in between solids and there are no preconditions. This is a common
    in cases where one is migrating workflows from other systems \--
    that do not have this concept \-- to dagster, or where the upstream
    solids are purely operational whose effects are difficult or awkward
    to model. For these cases we offer the `Nothing` type.

### Execution Order Dependencies

Sometimes one wishes to declare a dependency that specifies execution
order and does not encode a data dependency. This is often useful when
porting workflows into dagster from other systems with no notion of data
dependencies, or in cases where it is awkward to express a data
dependency.

Use of the `Nothing` type is used, typically point to a situation in
which although there does exist some semantic dependency between two
solids, usually to do with external state. An example would be a
database table created in an upstream solid with hard-coded name.

In general, a `Nothing` dependency is in actuality an unexpressed
dependency on external state, making a pipeline harder to understand,
and solids within that pipeline harder to test and reuse.

We also believe that any purely operational and environment concern
means that there are missing APIs or abstractions in Dagster itself. Our
goal is for as many solids and pipelines and possible to be expressed in
terms of pure business logic.

Here is an example usage of the `Nothing` type:

::: {.literalinclude lines="180-194" caption="serial_nothing_pipeline.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

Note that the input with the `Nothing` type is not passed to the solid
definition function. It is also not possible to use type annotations to
specify inputs and outputs with the `Nothing` type.
:py`InputDefinition`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and
`OutputDefinition` must be used.

`Nothing` is also useful when fanning in multiple dependencies. An input
with a `Nothing` type can depend on multiple outputs upstream. (Note:
this is also true for dagster.List)

::: {.literalinclude lines="198-233" caption="fanin_nothing_pipeline.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

Python Types and Dagster Types
------------------------------

As alluded to earlier, the user can create define their own 1:1
relationships between dagster types and Python types, making the
corresponding python type usable where the dagster type is expected.

This is convenient when one has business objects that require nothing
more than an `isinstance` check in the dagster type check *and* one
wishes to use them both in type annotations directly and as business
objects. These type definitions reduce boilerplate as well as deliver
out-of-the-box mypy compliance.

There are two APIs: :py`usable_as_dagster_type`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} \-- for direct annotations of class declarations \-- and
:py`make_python_type_usable_as_dagster_type`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} \-- for mapping *existing* classes. This is designed for
importing python types libraries that cannot be altered and mapping them
to dagster types.

::: {.literalinclude lines="267-277" caption="usable_as_dagster_type.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

And make\_python\_type\_usable\_as\_dagster\_type

::: {.literalinclude lines="281-294" caption="make_python_type_usable_as_dagster_type.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

This approach does have downsides. Importing these types will causes a
global side effect as there is an internal registry which manages these
types. This can introduce challenges in terms of testability and also
can causes in behavior based on import order.

Additionally some of the most useful patterns in the ecosystem are to
use type factories to programmatically create dagster types, such as in
our dagster-pandas module. In these cases a 1:1 mapping between dagster
type and python type *no longer exists*. E.g. in dagster-pandas the
python representation for all the dataframe variants is simply
[pandas.DataFrame]{.title-ref}.

For clearly scoped business objects, the reduction in boilerplate is
significant and eases mypy compliance, hence its inclusion in the public
dagster API.

We do *not* recommend that libraries use this pattern and instead rely
on other techniques to achieve mypy compliance.

### MyPy Compliance

Users who do not use \"usable-as-dagster\" python types types by choice
or necessity and who desire mypy compliance need additional support.

This is a challenge to do elegantly in light of the fact that as of mypy
0.761 there is no way to directly annotate a object to treat it as a
type during a type checking pass. However there is a way to do this.

::: {.literalinclude lines="162-174" caption="type_checking_mypy_compliance.py" linenos="" lineno-start="1" dedent="4" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples\_tests/intro\_tutorial\_tests/test\_type\_guide.py
:::

While not particularly elegant, this does work. We recommend
centralizing type definitions so that this style of definition is
compartmentalized to a single file.
