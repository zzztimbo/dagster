Peforming a backfill
====================

Now that we have a partition set defined for a pipeline, we can perform
a backfill over all the partitions.

To do backfills, make sure you\'ve set up a Run Launcher. In a separate
terminal window, run `dagit` for our current repository. Now let\'s run
`dagster pipeline backfill` and follow the prompts

``` {.console}
$ dagster pipeline backfill compute_total_stock_volume
    Pipeline: compute_total_stock_volume
Partition set: stock_ticker_partition_sets
Partitions:
                AAPL            GOOG            MSFT            TSLA

Do you want to proceed with the backfill (4 partitions)? [y/N]: t
Launching runs...
Launched backfill job `uufbdyqg`
```

The backfill script just launched 4 runs configured individually for
each partition. If we load dagit and filter for the tag
`dagster/backfill=uufbdyqg` we\'ll be able to see our four runs:
