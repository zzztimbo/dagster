Creating a Simple Partition Set
===============================

If we\'re trying to calculate the total volume of trades for all stocks
in January 2019, it might be difficult to get and process all the data
in one query. Since we already have a pipeline that calculates total
volume for a single stock, and it takes the stock ticker symbol as
config, we can create a partition set to make it easy to run the
pipeline for each partition.

Let\'s assume there\'s only four stocks in the world: `AAPL`, `GOOG`,
`MSFT`, `TSLA`

First, we write a function that returns a list of partitions. Here, our
partitions are simply the stock tickers, and we wrap them in
:py`Partition <dagster.Partition>`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
objects.

../../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/stocks/simple\_partitions.py

Next, we define a function that takes a
:py`Partition <dagster.Partition>`{.interpreted-text role="class"} and
returns config. We pass the
:py`Partition <dagster.Partition>`{.interpreted-text role="class"} value
to the `query_historical_stock_data` solid config, just like we did in
the previous section.

../../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/stocks/simple\_partitions.py
:::

Finally, using these two functions, we create a
:py`PartitionSetDefinition <dagster.PartitionSetDefinition>`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} named `stock_data_partitions_set`. We can register these
partitions decorating a function that returns a list of partition set
definitions with the
:py`@repository_partitions <dagster.repository_partitions>`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}

::: {.literalinclude linenos="" lines="19-29" language="python" caption="repository.py"}
../../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/stocks/simple\_partitions.py
:::

Finally, we add a reference to this function in `repository.yaml`,
alongside our repository definition function reference.

``` {.yaml}
partitions:
    file: repository.py
    fn: define_partitions
```

Now, let\'s load dagit again and head to the playground. If we click on
the preset button, we now also see our partition set. If we select it,
we can see all the partitions we have and preview the config they
generate.
