Conditional Execution/Branching
===============================

What are optional outputs?
--------------------------

An output can be marked as `is_optional` in an
`OutputDefinitions <dagster.OutputDefinition>`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}. This means that the output does not necessarily have to
be yielded by the solid.

If an optional output is not yielded, all downstream solids that depend
on the output will simply skip, such as short-circuiting or branching.

For example:

::: {.literalinclude linenos="" lines="8-11" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/how\_tos/conditional\_execution.py
:::

How do I conditionally branch in my pipeline?
---------------------------------------------

By taking advantage of optional outputs and skips, we can implement
branching in our pipeline.

For example, let's define a solid that has two optional outputs, and
only yields one based on a conditional:

::: {.literalinclude linenos="" lines="14-24" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/how\_tos/conditional\_execution.py
:::

Then, we can have two downstream solids `path_1` and `path_2` that
depend on output "a" and output "b", respectively:

::: {.literalinclude linenos="" lines="27-34" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/how\_tos/conditional\_execution.py
:::

Finally, we can wire these solids up in a pipeline:

::: {.literalinclude linenos="" lines="37-41" language="python"}
../../../../examples/dagster\_examples/how\_tos/conditional\_execution.py
:::

Depending on the value of the conditional, only `path_1` or `path_2`
will execute.

How do I manage error handling in a solid?
------------------------------------------

There are two types of possible errors that can happen in the body of a
solid's `compute_fn`:

1.  A python runtime exception that is unexpected
2.  Running into a known exception or invalid state

*Case 1: Python runtime exception*

When an exception is thrown in a solid's `compute_fn`, the error is
caught by a user error boundary and surfaced in the event stream. Any
downstream solids that depend on the solid will be marked as skipped and
will not execute.

*Case 2: Known invalid state or unrecoverable failure*

If you run into a known failure state, you can `raise` a
`Failure <dagster.Failure>`{.interpreted-text role="class"} event from a
solid to in order to notify the Dagster executor of the failure as well
as return structured metadata about the failure.

For example, a scenario where you want to \"fail successfully\" is when
you have an external data store that is not ready/available.

Any downstream solids that depend on the solid will be marked as skipped
and will not execute.
