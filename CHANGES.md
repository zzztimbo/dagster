# Changelog

## Upcoming (0.7.6)

**Breaking Changes**

- `default_value` in `Field` no longer accepts callables.
- The `dagster_aws` imports have been reorganized; you should now import resources from
  `dagster_aws.<AWS service name>`. `dagster_aws` provides `s3`, `emr`, `redshift`, and `cloudwatch`
  modules.
- The `dagster_aws` S3 resource no longer attempts to model the underlying boto3 API, and you can
  now just use any boto3 S3 API directly on a S3 resource, e.g.
  `context.resources.s3.list_objects_v2`. (#2292)

## 0.7.5

**New**

- Added the `IntSource` type, which lets integers be set from environment variables in config.
- You may now set tags on pipeline definitions. These will resolve in the following cases:

  1. Loading in the playground view in Dagit will pre-populate the tag container.
  2. Loading partition sets from the preset/config picker will pre-populate the tag container with
     the union of pipeline tags and partition tags, with partition tags taking precedence.
  3. Executing from the CLI will generate runs with the pipeline tags.
  4. Executing programmatically using the `execute_pipeline` api will create a run with the union
     of pipeline tags and `RunConfig` tags, with `RunConfig` tags taking precedence.
  5. Scheduled runs (both launched and executed) will have the union of pipeline tags and the
     schedule tags function, with the schedule tags taking precedence.

- Output materialization configs may now yield multiple Materializations, and the tutorial has
  been updated to reflect this.

- We now export the `SolidExecutionContext` in the public API so that users can correctly type hint
  solid compute functions.

**Dagit**

- Pipeline run tags are now preserved when resuming/retrying from Dagit.
- Scheduled run stats are now grouped by partition.
- A "preparing" section has been added to the execution viewer. This shows steps that are in
  progress of starting execution.
- Markers emitted by the underlying execution engines are now visualized in the Dagit execution
  timeline.

**Bugfix**

- Resume/retry now works as expected in the presence of solids that yield optional outputs.
- Fixed an issue where dagster-celery workers were failing to start in the presence of config
  values that were `None`.
- Fixed an issue with attempting to set `threads_per_worker` on Dask distributed clusters.

**dagster-postgres**

- All postgres config may now be set using environment variables in config.

**dagster-aws**

- The `s3_resource` now exposes a `list_objects_v2` method corresponding to the underlying boto3
  API. (Thanks, @basilvetas!)
- Added the `redshift_resource` to access Redshift databases.

**dagster-k8s**

- The `K8sRunLauncher` config now includes the `load_kubeconfig` and `kubeconfig_file` options.

**Documentation**

- Fixes and improvements.

**Dependencies**

- dagster-airflow no longer pins its werkzeug dependency.

**Community**

- We've added opt-in telemetry to Dagster so we can collect usage statistics in order to inform
  development priorities. Telemetry data will motivate projects such as adding features in
  frequently-used parts of the CLI and adding more examples in the docs in areas where users
  encounter more errors.

  We will not see or store solid definitions (including generated context) or pipeline definitions
  (including modes and resources). We will not see or store any data that is processed within solids
  and pipelines.

  If you'd like to opt in to telemetry, please add the following to `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml`:

      telemetry:
        enabled: true

- Thanks to @basilvetas and @hspak for their contributions!

## 0.7.4

**New**

- It is now possible to use Postgres to back schedule storage by configuring
  `dagster_postgres.PostgresScheduleStorage` on the instance.
- Added the `execute_pipeline_with_mode` API to allow executing a pipeline in test with a specific
  mode without having to specify `RunConfig`.
- Experimental support for retries in the Celery executor.
- It is now possible to set run-level priorities for backfills run using the Celery executor by
  passing `--celery-base-priority` to `dagster pipeline backfill`.
- Added the `@weekly` schedule decorator.

**Deprecations**

- The `dagster-ge` library has been removed from this release due to drift from the underlying
  Great Expectations implementation.

**dagster-pandas**

- `PandasColumn` now includes an `is_optional` flag, replacing the previous
  `ColumnExistsConstraint`.
- You can now pass the `ignore_missing_values flag` to `PandasColumn` in order to apply column
  constraints only to the non-missing rows in a column.

**dagster-k8s**

- The Helm chart now includes provision for an Ingress and for multiple Celery queues.

**Documentation**

- Improvements and fixes.

## 0.7.3

**New**

- It is now possible to configure a dagit instance to disable executing pipeline runs in a local
  subprocess.
- Resource initialization, teardown, and associated failure states now emit structured events
  visible in Dagit. Structured events for pipeline errors and multiprocess execution have been
  consolidated and rationalized.
- Support Redis queue provider in `dagster-k8s` Helm chart.
- Support external postgresql in `dagster-k8s` Helm chart.

**Bugfix**

- Fixed an issue with inaccurate timings on some resource initializations.
- Fixed an issue that could cause the multiprocess engine to spin forever.
- Fixed an issue with default value resolution when a config value was set using `SourceString`.
- Fixed an issue when loading logs from a pipeline belonging to a different repository in Dagit.
- Fixed an issue with where the CLI command `dagster schedule up` would fail in certain scenarios
  with the `SystemCronScheduler`.

**Pandas**

- Column constraints can now be configured to permit NaN values.

**Dagstermill**

- Removed a spurious dependency on sklearn.

**Docs**

- Improvements and fixes to docs.
- Restored dagster.readthedocs.io.

**Experimental**

- An initial implementation of solid retries, throwing a `RetryRequested` exception, was added.
  This API is experimental and likely to change.

**Other**

- Renamed property `runtime_type` to `dagster_type` in definitions. The following are deprecated
  and will be removed in a future version.
  - `InputDefinition.runtime_type` is deprecated. Use `InputDefinition.dagster_type` instead.
  - `OutputDefinition.runtime_type` is deprecated. Use `OutputDefinition.dagster_type` instead.
  - `CompositeSolidDefinition.all_runtime_types` is deprecated. Use `CompositeSolidDefinition.all_dagster_types` instead.
  - `SolidDefinition.all_runtime_types` is deprecated. Use `SolidDefinition.all_dagster_types` instead.
  - `PipelineDefinition.has_runtime_type` is deprecated. Use `PipelineDefinition.has_dagster_type` instead.
  - `PipelineDefinition.runtime_type_named` is deprecated. Use `PipelineDefinition.dagster_type_named` instead.
  - `PipelineDefinition.all_runtime_types` is deprecated. Use `PipelineDefinition.all_dagster_types` instead.

## 0.7.2

**Docs**

- New docs site at docs.dagster.io.
- dagster.readthedocs.io is currently stale due to availability issues.

**New**

- Improvements to S3 Resource. (Thanks @dwallace0723!)
- Better error messages in Dagit.
- Better font/styling support in Dagit.
- Changed `OutputDefinition` to take `is_required` rather than `is_optional` argument. This is to
  remain consistent with changes to `Field` in 0.7.1 and to avoid confusion
  with python's typing and dagster's definition of `Optional`, which indicates None-ability,
  rather than existence. `is_optional` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
- Added support for Flower in dagster-k8s.
- Added support for environment variable config in dagster-snowflake.

**Bugfixes**

- Improved performance in Dagit waterfall view.
- Fixed bug when executing solids downstream of a skipped solid.
- Improved navigation experience for pipelines in Dagit.
- Fixed for the dagster-aws CLI tool.
- Fixed issue starting Dagit without DAGSTER_HOME set on windows.
- Fixed pipeline subset execution in partition-based schedules.

## 0.7.1

  not available. (Thanks @rparrapy!)

**dagster_pandas**

- Hydration and materialization are now configurable on `dagster_pandas` dataframes.

**dagster_aws**

- The `s3_resource` no longer uses an unsigned session by default.

**Bugfixes**

- Type check messages are now displayed in Dagit.
- Failure metadata is now surfaced in Dagit.
- Dagit now correctly displays the execution time of steps that error.

**Documentation**

- Expanded and improved docs and error messages.

## 0.7.0

**Breaking Changes**

There are a substantial number of breaking changes in the 0.7.0 release.
Please see `070_MIGRATION.md` for instructions regarding migrating old code.

**_Scheduler_**

- The scheduler configuration has been moved from the `@schedules` decorator to `DagsterInstance`. Existing schedules
  that have been running are no longer compatible with current storage. To migrate,
  remove the `scheduler` argument on all `@schedules` decorators:

  instead of:

  ```
  @schedules(scheduler=SystemCronScheduler)
  def define_schedules():
    ...
  ```

  Remove the `scheduler` argument:

  ```
  @schedules
  def define_schedules():
    ...
  ```

  Next, configure the scheduler on your instance by adding the following to `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml`:

  ```
  scheduler:
    module: dagster_cron.cron_scheduler
    class: SystemCronScheduler
  ```

  Finally, if you had any existing schedules running, delete the existing `$DAGSTER_HOME/schedules` directory and run `dagster schedule wipe && dagster schedule up` to re-instatiate schedules in a valid state.

- The `should_execute` and `environment_dict_fn` argument to `ScheduleDefinition` now have a required first argument
  `context`, representing the `ScheduleExecutionContext`

**_Config System Changes_**

- In the config system, `Dict` has been renamed to `Shape`; `List` to `Array`; `Optional` to `Noneable`; and
  `PermissiveDict` to `Permissive`. The motivation here is to clearly delineate config use cases versus cases where you
  are using types as the inputs and outputs of solids as well as python typing types (for mypy and friends). We believe
  this will be clearer to users in addition to simplifying our own implementation and internal abstractions.

  Our recommended fix is _not_ to used Shape and Array, but instead to use our new condensed config specification API.
  This allow one to use bare dictionaries instead of `Shape`, lists with one member instead of `Array`, bare types
  instead of `Field` with a single argument, and python primitive types (`int`, `bool` etc) instead of the dagster
  equivalents. These result in dramatically less verbose config specs in most cases.

  So instead of

  ```
  from dagster import Shape, Field, Int, Array, String
  # ... code
  config=Shape({ # Dict prior to change
        'some_int' : Field(Int),
        'some_list: Field(Array[String]) # List prior to change
    })
  ```

  one can instead write:

  ```
  config={'some_int': int, 'some_list': [str]}
  ```

  No imports and much simpler, cleaner syntax.

- `config_field` is no longer a valid argument on `solid`, `SolidDefinition`, `ExecutorDefintion`, `executor`,
  `LoggerDefinition`, `logger`, `ResourceDefinition`, `resource`, `system_storage`, and `SystemStorageDefinition`. Use
  `config` instead.
- For composite solids, the `config_fn` no longer takes a `ConfigMappingContext`, and the context has been deleted. To
  upgrade, remove the first argument to `config_fn`.

  So instead of

  ```
  @composite_solid(config={}, config_fn=lambda context, config: {})
  ```

  one must instead write:

  ```
  @composite_solid(config={}, config_fn=lambda config: {})
  ```

- `Field` takes a `is_required` rather than a `is_optional` argument. This is to avoid confusion
  with python's typing and dagster's definition of `Optional`, which indicates None-ability,
  rather than existence. `is_optional` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

**_Required Resources_**

- All solids, types, and config functions that use a resource must explicitly list that
  resource using the argument `required_resource_keys`. This is to enable efficient
  resource management during pipeline execution, especially in a multiprocessing or
  remote execution environment.

- The `@system_storage` decorator now requires argument `required_resource_keys`, which was
  previously optional.

**_Dagster Type System Changes_**

- `dagster.Set` and `dagster.Tuple` can no longer be used within the config system.
- Dagster types are now instances of `DagsterType`, rather than a class than inherits from `RuntimeType`. Instead of
  dynamically generating a class to create a custom runtime type, just create an instance of a `DagsterType`. The type
  checking function is now an argument to the `DagsterType`, rather than an abstract method that has to be implemented in
  a subclass.
- `RuntimeType` has been renamed to `DagsterType` is now an encouraged API for type creation.
- Core type check function of DagsterType can now return a naked `bool` in addition
  to a `TypeCheck` object.
- `type_check_fn` on `DagsterType` (formerly `type_check` and `RuntimeType`, respectively) now takes a first argument
  `context` of type `TypeCheckContext` in addition to the second argument of `value`.
- `define_python_dagster_type` has been eliminated in favor of `PythonObjectDagsterType` .
- `dagster_type` has been renamed to `usable_as_dagster_type`.
- `as_dagster_type` has been removed and similar capabilities added as `make_python_type_usable_as_dagster_type`.
- `PythonObjectDagsterType` and `usable_as_dagster_type` no longer take a `type_check` argument. If
  a custom type_check is needed, use `DagsterType`.
- As a consequence of these changes, if you were previously using `dagster_pyspark` or `dagster_pandas` and expecting
  Pyspark or Pandas types to work as Dagster types, e.g., in type annotations to functions decorated with `@solid` to
  indicate that they are input or output types for a solid, you will need to call
  `make_python_type_usable_as_dagster_type` from your code in order to map the Python types to the Dagster types, or just
  use the Dagster types (`dagster_pandas.DataFrame` instead of `pandas.DataFrame`) directly.

**_Other_**

- We no longer publish base Docker images. Please see the updated deployment docs for an example
  Dockerfile off of which you can work.
- `step_metadata_fn` has been removed from `SolidDefinition` & `@solid`.
- `SolidDefinition` & `@solid` now takes `tags` and enforces that values are strings or
  are safely encoded as JSON. `metadata` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
- `resource_mapper_fn` has been removed from `SolidInvocation`.

**New**

- Dagit now includes a much richer execution view, with a Gantt-style visualization of step execution and a live timeline.
- Early support for Python 3.8 is now available, and Dagster/Dagit along with many of our libraries
  are now tested against 3.8. Note that several of our upstream dependencies have yet to publish
  wheels for 3.8 on all platforms, so running on Python 3.8 likely still involves building some
  dependencies from source.
- `dagster/priority` tags can now be used to prioritize the order of execution for the built-in in-process and
  multiprocess engines.
- `dagster-postgres` storages can now be configured with separate arguments and environment variables, such as:

  ```
  run_storage:
    module: dagster_postgres.run_storage
    class: PostgresRunStorage
    config:
      postgres_db:
        username: test
        password:
          env: ENV_VAR_FOR_PG_PASSWORD
        hostname: localhost
        db_name: test
  ```

- Support for `RunLauncher`s on `DagsterInstance` allows for execution to be "launched" outside of the Dagit/Dagster
  process. As one example, this is used by `dagster-k8s` to submit pipeline execution as a Kubernetes Job.
- Added support for adding tags to runs initiated from the `Playground` view in dagit.
- Added `@monthly_schedule` decorator.
- Added `Enum.from_python_enum` helper to wrap Python enums for config. (Thanks @kdungs!)
- **[dagster-bash]** The Dagster bash solid factory now passes along `kwargs` to the underlying
  solid construction, and now has a single `Nothing` input by default to make it easier to create a
  sequencing dependency. Also, logs are now buffered by default to make execution less noisy.
- **[dagster-aws]** We've improved our EMR support substantially in this release. The
  `dagster_aws.emr` library now provides an `EmrJobRunner` with various utilities for creating EMR
  clusters, submitting jobs, and waiting for jobs/logs. We also now provide a
  `emr_pyspark_resource`, which together with the new `@pyspark_solid` decorator makes moving
  pyspark execution from your laptop to EMR as simple as changing modes.
  **[dagster-pandas]** Added `create_dagster_pandas_dataframe_type`, `PandasColumn`, and `Constraint` API's in order for
  users to create custom types which perform column validation, dataframe validation, summary statistics emission, and
  dataframe serialization/deserialization.
- **[dagster-gcp]** GCS is now supported for system storage, as well as being supported with the Dask executor. (Thanks
  @habibutsu!) Bigquery solids have also been updated to support the new API.

**Bugfix**

- Ensured that all implementations of `RunStorage` clean up pipeline run tags when a run
  is deleted. Requires a storage migration, using `dagster instance migrate`.
- The multiprocess and Celery engines now handle solid subsets correctly.
- The multiprocess and Celery engines will now correctly emit skip events for steps downstream of failures and other
  skips.
- The `@solid` and `@lambda_solid` decorators now correctly wrap their decorated functions, in the sense of
  `functools.wraps`.
- Performance improvements in Dagit when working with runs with large configurations.
- The Helm chart in `dagster_k8s` has been hardened against various failure modes and is now compatible with Helm 2.
- SQLite run and event log storages are more robust to concurrent use.
- Improvements to error messages and to handling of user code errors in input hydration and output materialization logic.
- Fixed an issue where the Airflow scheduler could hang when attempting to load dagster-airflow pipelines.
- We now handle our SQLAlchemy connections in a more canonical way (thanks @zzztimbo!).
- Fixed an issue using S3 system storage with certain custom serialization strategies.
- Fixed an issue leaking orphan processes from compute logging.
- Fixed an issue leaking semaphores from Dagit.
- Setting the `raise_error` flag in `execute_pipeline` now actually raises user exceptions instead of a wrapper type.

**Documentation**

- Our docs have been reorganized and expanded (thanks @habibutsu, @vatervonacht, @zzztimbo). We'd love feedback and
  contributions!

**Thank you**
Thank you to all of the community contributors to this release!! In alphabetical order: @habibutsu, @kdungs,
@vatervonacht, @zzztimbo.

## 0.6.9

**Bugfix**

- Improved SQLite concurrency issues, uncovered while using concurrent nodes in Airflow
- Fixed sqlalchemy warnings (thanks @zzztimbo!)
- Fixed Airflow integration issue where a Dagster child process triggered a signal handler of a
  parent Airflow process via a process fork
- Fixed GCS and AWS intermediate store implementations to be compatible with read/write mode
  serialization strategies
- Improve test stability

**Documentation**

- Improved descriptions for setting up the cron scheduler (thanks @zzztimbo!)

## 0.6.8

**New**

- Added the dagster-github library, a community contribution from @Ramshackle-Jamathon and
  @k-mahoney!

**dagster-celery**

- Simplified and improved config handling.
- An engine event is now emitted when the engine fails to connect to a broker.

**Bugfix**

- Fixes a file descriptor leak when running many concurrent dagster-graphql queries (e.g., for
  backfill).
- The `@pyspark_solid` decorator now handles inputs correctly.
- The handling of solid compute functions that accept kwargs but which are decorated with explicit
  input definitions has been rationalized.
- Fixed race conditions in concurrent execution using SQLite event log storage with concurrent
  execution, uncovered by upstream improvements in the Python inotify library we use.

**Documentation**

- Improved error messages when using system storages that don't fulfill executor requirements.

## 0.6.7

**New**

- We are now more permissive when specifying configuration schema in order make constructing configuration schema more concise.
- When specifying the value of scalar inputs in config, one can now specify that value directly as the key of the input, rather than having to embed it within a `value` key.

**Breaking**

- The implementation of SQL-based event log storages has been consolidated,
  which has entailed a schema change. If you have event logs stored in a
  Postgres- or SQLite-backed event log storage, and you would like to maintain
  access to these logs, you should run `dagster instance migrate`. To check
  what event log storages you are using, run `dagster instance info`.
- Type matches on both sides of an `InputMapping` or `OutputMapping` are now enforced.

**New**

- Dagster is now tested on Python 3.8
- Added the dagster-celery library, which implements a Celery-based engine for parallel pipeline
  execution.
- Added the dagster-k8s library, which includes a Helm chart for a simple Dagit installation on a
  Kubernetes cluster.

**Dagit**

- The Explore UI now allows you to render a subset of a large DAG via a new solid
  query bar that accepts terms like `solid_name+*` and `+solid_name+`. When viewing
  very large DAGs, nothing is displayed by default and `*` produces the original behavior.
- Performance improvements in the Explore UI and config editor for large pipelines.
- The Explore UI now includes a zoom slider that makes it easier to navigate large DAGs.
- Dagit pages now render more gracefully in the presence of inconsistent run storage and event logs.
- Improved handling of GraphQL errors and backend programming errors.
- Minor display improvements.

**dagster-aws**

- A default prefix is now configurable on APIs that use S3.
- S3 APIs now parametrize `region_name` and `endpoint_url`.

**dagster-gcp**

- A default prefix is now configurable on APIs that use GCS.

**dagster-postgres**

- Performance improvements for Postgres-backed storages.

**dagster-pyspark**

- Pyspark sessions may now be configured to be held open after pipeline execution completes, to
  enable extended test cases.

**dagster-spark**

- `spark_outputs` must now be specified when initializing a `SparkSolidDefinition`, rather than in
  config.
- Added new `create_spark_solid` helper and new `spark_resource`.
- Improved EMR implementation.

**Bugfix**

- Fixed an issue retrieving output values using `SolidExecutionResult` (e.g., in test) for
  dagster-pyspark solids.
- Fixes an issue when expanding composite solids in Dagit.
- Better errors when solid names collide.
- Config mapping in composite solids now works as expected when the composite solid has no top
  level config.
- Compute log filenames are now guaranteed not to exceed the POSIX limit of 255 chars.
- Fixes an issue when copying and pasting solid names from Dagit.
- Termination now works as expected in the multiprocessing executor.
- The multiprocessing executor now executes parallel steps in the expected order.
- The multiprocessing executor now correctly handles solid subsets.
- Fixed a bad error condition in `dagster_ssh.sftp_solid`.
- Fixed a bad error message giving incorrect log level suggestions.

**Documentation**

- Minor fixes and improvements.

**Thank you**
Thank you to all of the community contributors to this release!! In alphabetical order: @cclauss,
@deem0n, @irabinovitch, @pseudoPixels, @Ramshackle-Jamathon, @rparrapy, @yamrzou.

## 0.6.6

**Breaking**

- The `selector` argument to `PipelineDefinition` has been removed. This API made it possible to
  construct a `PipelineDefinition` in an invalid state. Use `PipelineDefinition.build_sub_pipeline`
  instead.

**New**

- Added the `dagster_prometheus` library, which exposes a basic Prometheus resource.
- Dagster Airflow DAGs may now use GCS instead of S3 for storage.
- Expanded interface for schedule management in Dagit.

**Dagit**

- Performance improvements when loading, displaying, and editing config for large pipelines.
- Smooth scrolling zoom in the explore tab replaces the previous two-step zoom.
- No longer depends on internet fonts to run, allowing fully offline dev.
- Typeahead behavior in search has improved.
- Invocations of composite solids remain visible in the sidebar when the solid is expanded.
- The config schema panel now appears when the config editor is first opened.
- Interface now includes hints for autocompletion in the config editor.
- Improved display of solid inputs and output in the explore tab.
- Provides visual feedback while filter results are loading.
- Better handling of pipelines that aren't present in the currently loaded repo.

**Bugfix**

- Dagster Airflow DAGs previously could crash while handling Python errors in DAG logic.
- Step failures when running Dagster Airflow DAGs were previously not being surfaced as task
  failures in Airflow.
- Dagit could previously get into an invalid state when switching pipelines in the context of a
  solid subselection.
- `frozenlist` and `frozendict` now pass Dagster's parameter type checks for `list` and `dict`.
- The GraphQL playground in Dagit is now working again.

**Nits**

- Dagit now prints its pid when it loads.
- Third-party dependencies have been relaxed to reduce the risk of version conflicts.
- Improvements to docs and example code.

## 0.6.5

**Breaking**

- The interface for type checks has changed. Previously the `type_check_fn` on a custom type was
  required to return None (=passed) or else raise `Failure` (=failed). Now, a `type_check_fn` may
  return `True`/`False` to indicate success/failure in the ordinary case, or else return a
  `TypeCheck`. The new`success` field on `TypeCheck` now indicates success/failure. This obviates
  the need for the `typecheck_metadata_fn`, which has been removed.
- Executions of individual composite solids (e.g. in test) now produce a
  `CompositeSolidExecutionResult` rather than a `SolidExecutionResult`.
- `dagster.core.storage.sqlite_run_storage.SqliteRunStorage` has moved to
  `dagster.core.storage.runs.SqliteRunStorage`. Any persisted `dagster.yaml` files should be updated
  with the new classpath.
- `is_secret` has been removed from `Field`. It was not being used to any effect.
- The `environmentType` and `configTypes` fields have been removed from the dagster-graphql
  `Pipeline` type. The `configDefinition` field on `SolidDefinition` has been renamed to
  `configField`.

**Bugfix**

- `PresetDefinition.from_files` is now guaranteed to give identical results across all Python
  minor versions.
- Nested composite solids with no config, but with config mapping functions, now behave as expected.
- The dagster-airflow `DagsterKubernetesPodOperator` has been fixed.
- Dagit is more robust to changes in repositories.
- Improvements to Dagit interface.

**New**

- dagster_pyspark now supports remote execution on EMR with the `@pyspark_solid` decorator.

**Nits**

- Documentation has been improved.
- The top level config field `features` in the `dagster.yaml` will no longer have any effect.
- Third-party dependencies have been relaxed to reduce the risk of version conflicts.

## 0.6.4

- Scheduler errors are now visible in dagit
- Run termination button no longer persists past execution completion
- Fixes run termination for multiprocess execution
- Fixes run termination on Windows
- `dagit` no longer prematurely returns control to terminal on Windows
- `raise_on_error` is now available on the `execute_solid` test utility
- `check_dagster_type` added as a utility to help test type checks on custom types
- Improved support in the type system for `Set` and `Tuple` types
- Allow composite solids with config mapping to expose an empty config schema
- Simplified graphql API arguments to single-step re-execution to use `retryRunId`, `stepKeys` execution parameters instead of a `reexecutionConfig` input object
- Fixes missing step-level stdout/stderr from dagster CLI

## 0.6.3

- Adds a `type_check` parameter to `PythonObjectType`, `as_dagster_type`, and `@as_dagster_type` to enable custom
  type checks in place of default `isinstance` checks.
  See documentation here: https://dagster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/learn/tutorial/types.html#custom-type-checks
- Improved the type inference experience by automatically wrapping bare python types as dagster types.
- Reworked our tutorial (now with more compelling/scary breakfast cereal examples) and public API documentation.
  See the new tutorial here: https://dagster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/learn/tutorial/index.html
- New solids explorer in Dagit allows you to browse and search for solids used across the repository.

  ![Solid Explorer](./screenshots/solid_explorer.png)
  ![Solid Explorer](./screenshots/solid_explorer_input.png)

- Enabled solid dependency selection in the Dagit search filter.

  - To select a solid and its upstream dependencies, search `+{solid_name}`.
  - To select a solid and its downstream dependents, search `{solid_name}+`.
  - For both search `+{solid_name}+`.

  For example. In the Airline demo, searching `+join_q2_data` will get the following:

  ![Screenshot](./screenshots/airline_join_parent_filter.png)

- Added a terminate button in Dagit to terminate an active run.

  ![Stop Button](./screenshots/stop_button.png)

- Added an `--output` flag to `dagster-graphql` CLI.
- Added confirmation step for `dagster run wipe` and `dagster schedule wipe` commands (Thanks @shahvineet98).
- Fixed a wrong title in the `dagster-snowflake` library README (Thanks @Step2Web).

## 0.6.2

- Changed composition functions `@pipeline` and `@composite_solid` to automatically give solids
  aliases with an incrementing integer suffix when there are conflicts. This removes to the need
  to manually alias solid definitions that are used multiple times.
- Add `dagster schedule wipe` command to delete all schedules and remove all schedule cron jobs
- `execute_solid` test util now works on composite solids.
- Docs and example improvements: https://dagster.readthedocs.io/
- Added `--remote` flag to `dagster-graphql` for querying remote dagit servers.
- Fixed issue with duplicate run tag autocomplete suggestions in dagit (#1839)
- Fixed Windows 10 / py3.6+ bug causing pipeline execution failures

## 0.6.1

- Fixed an issue where Dagster public images tagged `latest` on Docker Hub were erroneously
  published with an older version of Dagster (#1814)
- Fixed an issue where the most recent scheduled run was not displayed in dagit (#1815)
- Fixed a bug with the `dagster schedule start --start-all` command (#1812)
- Added a new scheduler command to restart a schedule: `dagster schedule restart`. Also added a
  flag to restart all running schedules: `dagster schedule restart --restart-all-running`.

## 0.6.0

**New**

This major release includes features for scheduling, operating, and executing pipelines
that elevate dagit and dagster from a local development tool to a deployable service.

- `DagsterInstance` introduced as centralized system to control run, event, compute log,
  and local intermediates storage.
- A `Scheduler` abstraction has been introduced along side an initial implementation of
  `SystemCronScheduler` in `dagster-cron`.
- `dagster-aws` has been extended with a CLI for deploying dagster to AWS. This can spin
  up a Dagit node and all the supporting infrastructure—security group, RDS PostgreSQL
  instance, etc.—without having to touch the AWS console, and for deploying your code
  to that instance.
- **Dagit**
  - `Runs`: a completely overhauled Runs history page. Includes the ability to `Retry`,
    `Cancel`, and `Delete` pipeline runs from the new runs page.
  - `Scheduler`: a page for viewing and interacting with schedules.
  - `Compute Logs`: stdout and stderr are now viewable on a per execution step basis in each run.
    This is available in real time for currently executing runs and for historical runs.
  - A `Reload` button in the top right in dagit restarts the web-server process and updates
    the UI to reflect repo changes, including DAG structure, solid names, type names, etc.
    This replaces the previous file system watching behavior.

**Breaking Changes**

- `--log` and `--log-dir` no longer supported as CLI args. Existing runs and events stored
  via these flags are no longer compatible with current storage.
- `raise_on_error` moved from in process executor config to argument to arguments in
  python API methods such as `execute_pipeline`

## 0.5.9

- Fixes an issue using custom types for fan-in dependencies with intermediate storage.

## 0.5.8

- Fixes an issue running some Dagstermill notebooks on Windows.
- Fixes a transitive dependency issue with Airflow.
- Bugfixes, performance improvements, and better documentation.

## 0.5.7

- Fixed an issue with specifying composite output mappings (#1674)
- Added support for specifying
  [Dask worker resources](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/resources.html) (#1679)
- Fixed an issue with launching Dagit on Windows

## 0.5.6

- Execution details are now configurable. The new top-level `ExecutorDefinition` and `@executor`
  APIs are used to define in-process, multiprocess, and Dask executors, and may be used by users to
  define new executors. Like loggers and storage, executors may be added to a `ModeDefinition` and
  may be selected and configured through the `execution` field in the environment dict or YAML,
  including through Dagit. Executors may no longer be configured through the `RunConfig`.
- The API of dagster-dask has changed. Pipelines are now executed on Dask using the
  ordinary `execute_pipeline` API, and the Dask executor is configured through the environment.
  (See the dagster-dask README for details.)
- Added the `PresetDefinition.from_files` API for constructing a preset from a list of environment
  files (replacing the old usage of this class). `PresetDefinition` may now be directly
  instantiated with an environment dict.
- Added a prototype integration with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).
- Added a prototype integration with [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/).
- Added a prototype integration with [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/).
- Added the dagster-bash library.
- Added the dagster-ssh library.
- Added the dagster-sftp library.
- Loosened the PyYAML compatibility requirement.
- The dagster CLI no longer takes a `--raise-on-error` or `--no-raise-on-error` flag. Set this
  option in executor config.
- Added a `MarkdownMetadataEntryData` class, so events yielded from client code may now render
  markdown in their metadata.
- Bug fixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to error display.

## 0.5.5

- Dagit now accepts parameters via environment variables prefixed with `DAGIT_`, e.g. `DAGIT_PORT`.
- Fixes an issue with reexecuting Dagstermill notebooks from Dagit.
- Bug fixes and display improvments in Dagit.

## 0.5.4

- Reworked the display of structured log information and system events in Dagit, including support
  for structured rendering of client-provided event metadata.
- Dagster now generates events when intermediates are written to filesystem and S3 storage, and
  these events are displayed in Dagit and exposed in the GraphQL API.
- Whitespace display styling in Dagit can now be toggled on and off.
- Bug fixes, display nits and improvements, and improvements to JS build process, including better
  display for some classes of errors in Dagit and improvements to the config editor in Dagit.

## 0.5.3

- Pinned RxPY to 1.6.1 to avoid breaking changes in 3.0.0 (py3-only).
- Most definition objects are now read-only, with getters corresponding to the previous properties.
- The `valueRepr` field has been removed from `ExecutionStepInputEvent` and `ExecutionStepOutputEvent`.
- Bug fixes and dagit UX improvements, including SQL highlighting and error handling.

## 0.5.2

- Added top-level `define_python_dagster_type` function.
- Renamed `metadata_fn` to `typecheck_metadata_fn` in all runtime type creation APIs.
- Renamed `result_value` and `result_values` to `output_value` and `output_values` on `SolidExecutionResult`
- Dagstermill: Reworked public API now contains only `define_dagstermill_solid`, `get_context`,
  `yield_event`, `yield_result`, `DagstermillExecutionContext`, `DagstermillError`, and
  `DagstermillExecutionError`. Please see the new
  [guide](https://dagster.readthedocs.io/en/0.5.2/sections/learn/guides/data_science/data_science.html)
  for details.
- Bug fixes, including failures for some dagster CLI invocations and incorrect handling of Airflow
  timestamps.
